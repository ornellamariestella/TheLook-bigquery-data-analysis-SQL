# Unlocking E-Commerce Insights using SQL and BigQuery  :unlock: 

Welcome to my *The Look E-Commerce* case study! :sparkles:

As part of my journey into the world of data, I have created this repo to showcase my proficiency in SQL and BigQuery gained during my training course in [Data Analytics with Boolean](https://boolean.co.uk/course/part-time-data-analytics-online-course). 


## The analysis

I have conducted a, analysis targeting three main areas: 

- [Customer Insights](https://github.com/ornellamariestella/bigquery-sql-project/blob/main/Customer%20insights/overview_and_insights.md)
- [Order Status](https://github.com/ornellamariestella/bigquery-sql-project/blob/main/Order%20status/overview_and_insights.md)
- [Delivery Timeframes](https://github.com/ornellamariestella/bigquery-sql-project/blob/main/Delivery%20timeframes/overview_and_insights.md)

For each area, I have answered a few business questions through the use of data. Click on each folder to browse through my insights :blush:

## The dataset

“The Look E-Commerce” is a [publicly available dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-data/thelook-ecommerce?authuser=0&project=big-query-data-projects) based on an e-commerce clothing store. 

The entire dataset consists of 7 tables:
-   Distribution_centers    
-   Events    
-   Inventory_items    
-   Order_items    
-   Orders    
-   Products    
-   Users

As of now, we can visualize information about orders with creation date between 2019-01-08 and 2024-03-25.
